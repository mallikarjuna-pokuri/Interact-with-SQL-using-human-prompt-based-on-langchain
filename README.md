# SQLChat: Conversational SQL Interface

Welcome to SQLChat, your conversational interface to interact seamlessly with a SQL database using LangChain.

## Overview

SQLChat enables users to engage in natural language conversations with a SQL database. LangChain powers the underlying natural language processing, transforming user prompts into SQL queries for interacting with the database. This project aims to provide an intuitive and human-friendly way to query and retrieve information from a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Engage in natural language conversations with your SQL database.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for natural language processing and SQL query generation.
- **Seamless eSQL Connection**: Easily connect and interact with your SQL database through a chat-based interface.
